# Notify My GO-JEK Driver
Communication with our drivers is important and we take it personally. 

We would like to communicate messages personally to drivers via notification.

## The Components
Below is the component that I have made

### Table Component

This component will accept props from the parent for iterations, as well as methods from the parent that will be used in this component

### PopUp Component
